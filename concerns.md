❓According to huge CEXs like MEXC, what should  under 'close' toggle closing with limit do?? same as setting TP/SL?


🟡 Implementation: Favorite assets inside market page and asset selector as separate toggle
Should have assets divided into Futures and then optionally into 2 MORE - USDT and USDC lists
❓If we split spot and futures into USDT and USDC, would that save a lot of energy or just a bit?
