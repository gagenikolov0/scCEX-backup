🟡 Share PNL bro

🟡 Slider for available amount in futures and spot right below input

🟡 Icons for assets bro

🟡 Isolated and Cross

🟡 In the future we are gonna want Unrealized PNL, close position button and liquidation on chart

🟡 The asset selector should appear on hover. And you should make it when hovering thats when ws updadtes
come same one that shows everything in market page litrally everything the same just smaller UI obviously



❓According to huge CEXs like MEXC what is using toggle button and then limit means setting TP/SL?



❓ Cant see full chart history - limited to 200 candles, but 200 candles applied to all intervals/charts?



❓ Which css file is for wallet.tsx?



🟡 Favorite assets inside market page and asset selector as separate toggle
Should have assets divided into Futures and then optionally into 2 MORE - USDT and USDC lists
❓If we split spot and futures into USDT and USDC, would that save a lot of energy or just a bit?



❌So we call user/account every 10 seconds and we call user/account on focus.
If we are in home page or market page i dont think i should be calling user/account



❌We need complete UI Refactor The mantine responsiveness is not bad but duplicate vertical
scrollbars appear



❓I wanna know exactly where priceService is fed by both ticks and stats at the same time and how
is that even possible



❓There's draw mode in PriceChart but not visible in the app????



❓Close button and draw button still not visible on chart



❓Realiezd pnl should be shown in position table right next to Unrealized so when person closes e.g. 50%, 
50% of unrealized should become realized just like in futures history (which is perfect btw) only it 
should also be shown in position table, simple.



❓Futures total price doesn't work well not accurate
