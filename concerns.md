❓According to huge CEXs like MEXC, what should  under 'close' toggle closing with limit do?? same as setting TP/SL?



❓ Shouldn't the app refresh after token is removed when logged out, not only remove the refresh token and that's it?



❓ Cant see full chart history - limited to 200 candles, but 200 candles applied to all intervals/charts? i want 1000 candles for all intervals
Also when SOME chart loads it only shows the last candle before i have to zoom out to see the rest available candles or pull to the right which i hate lot more, while on some intervals the chart loads nicely, visible many candles not just one.


❓ Which css file is for wallet.tsx?



🟡 Implementation: Favorite assets inside market page and asset selector as separate toggle
Should have assets divided into Futures and then optionally into 2 MORE - USDT and USDC lists
❓If we split spot and futures into USDT and USDC, would that save a lot of energy or just a bit?



❓So we call user/account every 10 seconds and we call user/account on focus.
If we are in home page or market page i dont think i should be calling user/account
Also, everytime a logged in user refreshes page the server receives HTTP???? if people keep refreshing the page the server will die



❌We need complete UI Refactor The mantine responsiveness is not bad but duplicate vertical
scrollbars appear



❌ When opening a position with limit order on the pair that already is in postition instead of normally wait for price to become limit price and than just add the margin, it actually only deducts the available balance and nothing happens.
When opening market position on a pair that we already have position it works well it just adds the marin instantly.




❓Futures total price doesn't work well not accurate



❓in position table after we set TP/SL what does TP/SL show right next to our price? its some percentage
but i dont get what percentage of what
