❓According to huge CEXs like MEXC, what should  under 'close' toggle closing with limit do?? same as setting TP/SL?



❓ Shouldn't the app refresh after token is removed when logged out, not only remove the refresh token and that's it?



❓ Cant see full chart history - limited to 200 candles, but 200 candles applied to all intervals/charts?
Also when chart loads it only shows the last candle before i have to zoom out to see the rest 200 candles or pull to the right


❓ Which css file is for wallet.tsx?



🟡 Implementation: Favorite assets inside market page and asset selector as separate toggle
Should have assets divided into Futures and then optionally into 2 MORE - USDT and USDC lists
❓If we split spot and futures into USDT and USDC, would that save a lot of energy or just a bit?



❓So we call user/account every 10 seconds and we call user/account on focus.
If we are in home page or market page i dont think i should be calling user/account



❌We need complete UI Refactor The mantine responsiveness is not bad but duplicate vertical
scrollbars appear



❓There's draw mode in PriceChart but not visible in the app????
❓Close button and draw button still not visible on chart



❓Realiezd pnl should be shown in position table right next to Unrealized so when person closes e.g. 50%, 
50% of unrealized should become realized just like in futures history (which is perfect btw) only it 
should also be shown in position table, simple.



❓Futures total price doesn't work well not accurate



❓in position table after we set TP/SL what does TP/SL show right next to our price? its some percentage
but i dont get what percentage of what
